Description: GitHub apps provide a powerful way to manage fine grained
    programmatic access to specific git repositories, without having to
    create dummy users, and which are safer than a PAT for automated tasks. 
    This package extends 'gh' to let you authenticate and interact with the
    GitHub API in R on behalf of an app.
