Description: 'GitHub' apps provide a powerful way to manage fine grained
    programmatic access to specific 'git' repositories, without having to
    create dummy users, and which are safer than a personal access token
    for automated tasks. This package extends the 'gh' package to let you
    authenticate and interact with 'GitHub' <https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview>
    in 'R' as an app.
